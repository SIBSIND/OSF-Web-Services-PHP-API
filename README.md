structWSF-PHP-API
=================

The **structWSF PHP API** is a framework available to PHP developers to help them generating queries to any structWSF web service endpoint. Each structWSF web service endpoint has its own WebServiceQuery class in the structWSF PHP API. This class is used to generate any query, to send it to be endpoint of a structWSF instance and to get back a resultset. The resultset can then be manipulated by using the Resultset API. This same API can be used to transform the resultset in different formats.

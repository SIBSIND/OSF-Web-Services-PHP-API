New prefixes<->namespaces can be defined in the namespaces.csv file. All these namespaces definitions 
will be taken into account by the Namespaces class, and will be added to the core ones defined
within the Namespaces class.

If you want to make sure to have most of the namespaces currently used on the Web, you should rename
the namespaces.extensive.csv file for namespaces.csv. This list of nearly 900 namespaces is coming
from the http://prefix.cc website which aggregates most of the namespaces encountered on the web.
